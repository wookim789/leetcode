     * [problem]
     * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
     * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day
     * to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
     * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
     * If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
     *
     * [example]
     * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
     * Output: 5
     * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
     * Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
     *
     * [boundary condition]
     * 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
     * 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
